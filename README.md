# Music-Data-Analysis-SQL
## Project Objective 
I analyzed the Kaggle Music Database by creating a structured SQL database with multiple tables. Using advanced SQL techniques (window functions, subqueries, HAVING, aggregates), I answered key business questions such as the most popular genre, top customers, and regions with the highest song engagement. This project strengthened my SQL skills while delivering meaningful insights from real-world data.
